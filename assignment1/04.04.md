##Testing

Approximately 20% of marks in this assignment is for the testing strategy. You are required to provide the following:

- JUnit test cases + a series of tests
- For the tests you write - indicate in a comment the ‘type’ of test you are intending. This ‘type’ can be drawn from the ‘pragmatic’ guidelines:CORRECT (7 guidelines), RIGHT Bicep (5 guidelines)
- Coverage will be measured (but with modest expectations).
