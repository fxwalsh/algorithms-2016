#Upgrade PacemakerAPI

PacemakerAPI currently uses a List data structure. It might make sense to rework this to use a Map - keyed on the email address.

First, redefine the users collection in PacemakerAPI to be a map:

~~~java
  private Map<String, User> users = new HashMap<String, User>();
~~~

(import the libraries in the usual way)

This will require some changes to the api itself:

- getUsers will return a collection, not a list, of the user in the map:

~~~java
  public Collection<User> getUsers ()
  {
    return users.values();
  }
~~~

- putting a user into the collection will be different:

~~~java
  public User createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password) 
  {
    User user = new User (firstName, lastName, email, password);
    users.put(email, user);
    return user;
  }
~~~

- searching for a user, though, becomes simpler:

~~~java
  public User getUser(String email) 
  {
    return users.get(email);
  }
~~~

- as does deleteUser:

~~~java
  public void deleteUser(String email) 
  {
    users.remove(email);
  }
~~~

There will be an error in Main when these changes are introduced (see if you can fix it).
Verify that the app works as expected.

Commit these changes with a suitable commit message.

The creation of the Map is a little verbose:

~~~java
  private Map<String, User> users = new HashMap<String, User>();
~~~

Java 7 simplifies this with a new syntax:

~~~java
  private Map<String, User> users = new HashMap<>();
~~~

Eliminating the repetition of the type parameters.

If we are using maps - it is recommended that the hash functions used be associated with the actual (preferably unique) values in the object to be inserted into the container.

We should also strengthen the hash associated with the User class, as we are now storing it in a Map. The Guava libraries we have imported provide some guidance and support:

- <https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/HashingExplained>

and we can refactor User to use its hash functions. First, import the requisite class:

~~~java
import com.google.common.base.Objects;
~~~

...and then implement the hash function to use our objects attributes:

~~~java
  @Override  
  public int hashCode()  
  {  
     return Objects.hashCode(this.lastName, this.firstName, this.email, this.password);  
  }  
~~~

Note the user of the 'Override' attribute - discussed here:

- [Override](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/94361/when-do-you-use-javas-override-annotation-and-why)

We should also add override to toString:

~~~java
  @Override
  public String toString()
  {
    return toStringHelper(this).addValue(firstName)
                               .addValue(lastName)
                               .addValue(password)
                               .addValue(email)                               
                               .toString();
  }
~~~

The Main class will no longer be compiling - the call to getUsers now returns a `Collection` instead of a `List`:

~~~
    Collection<User> users = pacemakerAPI.getUsers();
~~~

When everything is compiling and running correctly, commit all changes with a suitable message and push to github.
