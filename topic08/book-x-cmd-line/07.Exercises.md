##Exercises  Scripting

Look again at the complete command list:

~~~
Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pm> ?list-all
abbrev  name  params
!rs !run-script (filename)
!el !enable-logging (fileName)
!dl !disable-logging  ()
!gle  !get-last-exception ()
!sdt  !set-display-time (do-display-time)
?l  ?list (startsWith)
?l  ?list ()
?h  ?help (command-name)
?h  ?help ()
?la ?list-all ()
?ghh  ?generate-HTML-help (file-name, include-prefixed)
gu  get-user  (email)
gu  get-users ()
cu  create-user (first name, last name, email, password)
du  delete-user (email)
aa  add-activity  (user-id, type, location, distance)
al  add-location  (activity-id, latitude, longitude)
pm>
~~~

The `!rs` command will allow you to save a sequence of commands to a file, and the run the lot. Try this now - it might be useful for some simple testing.
