#Setup

This lab assumes you have completed the previous lab - this is the complete archive here:

- [pacemaker-tdd-05.zip](archives/pacemaker-tdd-05.zip)

This lab will attach a command line interface to pacemaker. We will use this library here:

- <https://code.google.com/p/cliche/>

It has been ported to github here:

- <https://github.com/budhash/cliche>

For our purposes, we can just use this jar file:

- [asg.cliche-110413.jar](archives/asg.cliche-110413.jar)

Download the jar, copy it to the `lib` folder of the pacemaker project and add it to the build
