#Equals Method

In order to verify that the full object graph is being compared, place breakpoints in the equals() method in User, Activity and Location, and run the test again in the debugger.

Do you notice anything unusual?

Only the User.equals() method is being triggered, the activities or locations equals are never called. This is because the equals method in User is incomplete. Here is a revision, which includes the extra method call:

~~~java
  @Override
  public boolean equals(final Object obj)
  {
    if (obj instanceof User)
    {
      final User other = (User) obj;
      return Objects.equal(firstName,   other.firstName) 
          &&  Objects.equal(lastName,    other.lastName)
          &&  Objects.equal(email,       other.email)
          &&  Objects.equal(password,    other.password)
          &&  Objects.equal(activities,  other.activities);      
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
~~~

This test should still run successfully, but perform a more effective 'deep compare' of the full object graph.

Finally, reflect again on this 'populate' method:

~~~java
  void populate (PacemakerAPI pacemaker)
  {
    for (User user : users)
    {
      pacemaker.createUser(user.firstName, user.lastName, user.email, user.password);
    }
    User user1 = pacemaker.getUserByEmail(users[0].email);
    Activity activity = pacemaker.createActivity(user1.id, activities[0].type, activities[0].location, activities[0].distance);
    pacemaker.createActivity(user1.id, activities[1].type, activities[1].location, activities[1].distance);
    User user2 = pacemaker.getUserByEmail(users[1].email);
    pacemaker.createActivity(user2.id, activities[2].type, activities[2].location, activities[2].distance);
    pacemaker.createActivity(user2.id, activities[3].type, activities[3].location, activities[3].distance);
    
    for (Location location : locations)
    {
      pacemaker.addLocation(activity.id, location.latitude, location.longitude);
    }
  }
~~~

This is very clumsy and poorly abstracted code. Are there alternative approaches?
