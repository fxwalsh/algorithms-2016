###JSON

For many uses, XML has largely been replaced with JSON:

- <http://www.json.org/>

Which offers some considerable benefits as a simple representation of data structures. The xtream library  supports JSON:

- <http://x-stream.github.io/json-tutorial.html>

You will need these additional jar files to use incorporate JSON into the existing pacemaker project:

- [jettison](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.jettison/jettison/1.3.7)
- [stax](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/stax/stax/1.2.0)


Design a new class called JSONSerializer - whose task is to persist the pacemaker models to JSON instead of XML.

Note - you already have built a useful test for this - so the implementation will have immediate access to a regression test to see if it works successfully or not.
