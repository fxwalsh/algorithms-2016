## Data

You are provided with the following weighed data adapted from  [Wiktionary](./data/wiktionary.txt). The file contains the 10,000 most common words along with weights equal to their frequencies. You will have to write your own code that can parse the data. There is one term per line, with the weight and term separated by a tab. The terms can be arbitrary strings consisting of Unicode characters, including spaces (but not newlines).

The following code example, contained in the [class resources repo](https://github.com/fxwalsh/algorithms-2016-examples.git), uses the Scanner class to read in a text file line by line, parse the data, and print the data to the standard output:

~~~ java
File usersFile = new File("./data/userdata.txt");
  Scanner inUsers = new Scanner(usersFile);
  String delims = "[ ]";//each field in the file is separated(delimited) by a space.
  while (inUsers.hasNextLine()) {
    // get user and rating from data source
    String userDetails = inUsers.nextLine();
    // parse user details string
    String[] userTokens = userDetails.split(delims);

    // output user data to console.
    if (userTokens.length == 2) {
      System.out.println("UserID: " + userTokens[0] + ",First Name:" + userTokens[1]);

    }else
    {
      inUsers.close();
      throw new Exception("Invalid member length: "+userTokens.length);
    }
  }
  inUsers.close();
~~~

The above code produces output similar to the following:

>UserID: 1,First Name:bob
>UserID: 2,First Name:jack
>UserID: 3,First Name:donald
>UserID: 4,First Name:mary


You will also need to design and implement a suitable data type(s) that will support the functionality of the program.
