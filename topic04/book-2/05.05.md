##QuickAutocompete.java

For the brute force solution, when N is large, the number of autocomplete queries that can be processed per second will be too small to be useful. You can use it as a reference when developing a faster solution.
To improve on your brute force soluion, think of ways to increase the efficiency of finding matching terms based on what you have covered in lectures and practicals so far.
One approach you could take is use a suitable sorting algorithm to sort the list of terms. This should position matching terms(if any) in a continuous "block" in the list. You could then extract the matching sublist by searching for the first and last index position of the matching "block".

If you take this approach, try to come up with your own data type/API that provides this capabilbity for a sorted list. (HINT: create an extension of Binary Search).
