# Problem Description
[Autocomplete ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete) features in many applications such as search engines(Google), email programs etc.
You would noticed the autocomplete mechanism in the Eclipse Java source code editor.

Your assignment is to develop a java program that reads in a list of strings(called **terms**) and associated weights from a URL or file and stores them in a suitable data structure. The user should then be able to enter a prefix string and the program should return a list of matching phrases that start with that text. All matching phrases should be displayed and the search should be case insensitive.

## String Weighs
Most autocomplete application predict how likely it is that the user is typing each term. For this purpose, each term has a **weight** and your program will use these to compute a list of the top matching terms, in decreasing order of weight.

The weights are calculated using various data, such as number of plays for movie streaming services, frequencies of search queries from other Google users, or the typing history of a smart phone user.
In this assignment, you will be given a list of all terms and associated weights (and the terms and weights will not change).

## Performance
The performance of autocomplete functionality is critical in many systems. For example, the Google search engine runs an autocomplete application. It also performs this computation for every keystroke typed into the search bar and for every user! Therefore application has to return a list of suggestions in a short time  for it to be useful to the user. It also performs this computation for every keystroke typed into the search bar and for every user!
